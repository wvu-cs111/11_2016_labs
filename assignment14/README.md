# Lab Assignment 14
## BTrees

### Objectives 
1. Implement basic binary tree methods
2. Understand how to build and search a binary search tree
3. Play with binary trees
4. Write JUnit tests to validate your code
5. Push your code to Github
6. Be curious, have fun

### Suggestions for experimentation
Encode and decode a string with [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

Convert an expression (prefix, postfix, infix) into a [binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree), use different tree traversals to create prefix/postfix/infix expressions. Bonus: Java 8 functional interface to evaluate the tree

Create a family tree and convert it to a binary tree (remember, with a binary tree you only have one parent, so you won't be able to represent marriage).

Implement an [iterator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html) for a tree. Perhaps different iterators for different traversals? Bonus: Maybe find a way to use a forEach() loop.

For the bold, a skip tree version of a [skip list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list)

Or come up with something else (you should probably discuss with me first before deciding on a custom project)

### Submission Deadline
You can work on this lab throughout the week. The final submission will be due at the end of lab next week.

Final submission should be uploaded to ECampus.
